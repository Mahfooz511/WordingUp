09:36:18.000000 :<div id=about><h3>About The Site:</h3><p>   I created this site to fulfill my own need. There are many occasions when we need to make our documents, email, status updates etc. more effective with alternate stronger words. There are sites and tools available to check misspelling and get synonyms for a single word but they are not very convenient. Using this website you can just copy-paste or type in your text and click the button. Within seconds all those words for which Synonyms are found will be highlighted. Now, just click those words you think should be replaced with better word and select the appropriate word from the menu.</p>
	<br />
	<h3>About The Creator:</h3><p>    My name is Mahfooz. I am an IT professional with a high level of enthusiasm for technology. I have more than 12 years of experience in IT. I have experience in various fields of IT like Developement, Business Analyst, Project Management, Networking, System Admin etc. <br /><br />You can contact me on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mahfooz.khan.54" target="_   blank" rel="me">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mahfoozk" target="_blank" rel="me">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/mahfooz-khan/19/21b/325" target="_blank" rel="me">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

	<h3>Hints:</h3><p>    1. In background we have not implemented any linguistic intelligence. The synonyms you see comes from the database and they can be out of context.
	<br />    2. Some words do not get synonym because they are not in their simple form. For example word "climbed" would not get any synonym but word "climb" would. Similarly, word "beautifully" wont get any synonym but word "beautiful" will get. Edit words just to get synonyms and then change your text later.
	<br />    3. We do not check spelling. Spell check option is enabled and it totally depends on the browser you are using.
	<br />    4. We are aware about some bugs this tool has and we are working to rectify them. At the moment this site has some issues in Safari, and on ios platform.</p></div>
